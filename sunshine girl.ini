Shine my heart, it's a beautiful day
Make up, and dressed Are you ready to go?
Weather is great, it's my holiday
We gotta party all day long
Happy day Summer day Sunshine girl
I like it, Happy day Summer day
Sun shines for you
Happy day Summer day Sunshine girl
I like it, Happy day Summer day
Sun shines for you
Open the window shade, shut my eyes and feel the shine
Hummingbirds and tiny flowers telling me to step outside
And I take a deep breath
Start walking by the street
Everything looks a little bit different today
You see, Sunshine girl
Shine my heart, it's a beautiful day
Lights get brighter on the sea shore
Set me free, it's my holiday
Step with the music all day long
Happy day Summer day Sunshine girl

Time's passing by so fast
It never looks the same again
Everyday by day I'm moving on, rhythmically step by step
I wanna see your big smile, it makes it all better
Everything feels a little bit warmer today
Shine my heart, it's a beautiful day
Whistle a melody on the sea shore
Set me free, it's my holiday
Step with the music all day long
Happy day Summer day Sunshine girl

When the rainy days brings me down
Appreciate the moments in my life
Never forget little joys in a day
Good times aren't ever quite enough
Just wanna have a smile on my face
And keep looking up to the blue sky

7 to the 6, need my hair fix
5 to the 4, what you waiting for?
